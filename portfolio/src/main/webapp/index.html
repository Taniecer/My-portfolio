        Hello, My name is Taniece Ricketts. I am 19 years old. I was born 
        and raised on the beautiful island of Jamaica, in a small community 
        called Bethel Town, Westmoreland. I grew up in an extended family, 
        surrounded by lots of love and laughter. I have 3 siblings and a ton 
        of cousins of all age groups. This gave me the opportunity to always 
        have someone older to look up to for guidance in whatever situation. 
        Also, I was readily available to provide the same resources to the 
        younger ones. My family has always been my support system and in 
        many ways they helped greatly to shape the young lady I am today.

        Three years ago, I migrated to the United States to further my educational 
        journey. I am currently a rising junior at the illustrious 
        <a href="https://www.aamu.edu/about/index.html" target = "_blank"> Alabama A&M Univeristy. </a> 
        I am an active member of the International Students Association (ISA) on campus which is a 
        safe space for students to have someone going through similar situations. When I am not 
        working or doing school work, I enjoy dancing, singing, and hanging out with friends. 
        In the future, I would like to become a Software Engineer at Google and work my way up 
        to Manager or even Director. Also, I aspire to travel the world.
